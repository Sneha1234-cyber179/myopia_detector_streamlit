# Myopia Detection Streamlit App

This Streamlit app captures left and right eye images from the browser camera,
downloads the model from Google Drive, runs predictions, and provides a report.

**How to deploy**
1. Put these files in a GitHub repo.
2. Go to https://share.streamlit.io and create a new app pointing to your repo and `app.py`.
3. The app will download the model from Google Drive automatically on first run.
